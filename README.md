# StaticServer (Golang Echo)
Server implementation for serving static content in Golang. This is for convenience and by no means a product. This assumes you have Go CLI installed.

# How to set it up:
```
git clone git@github.com:StrajnarFilip/StaticServer.git  
cd StaticServer  
.\install.ps1  
```
